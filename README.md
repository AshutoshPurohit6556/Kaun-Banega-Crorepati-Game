Hello everyone. You already know about the project. Now let's see how to use it:
First of all, these files are compatible with Turbo C++ only. So, download all the files, and copy them to the BIN folder of Turbo C++, which might be located in C: drive
Now, run Turbo C++, and open KBC.cpp. It already has the links between the KBC.h, ADMIN.txt and PLAYER.txt files. Just run the code.

If you have any queries, feel free to write to me on ashutoshpurohit2000@gmail.com
